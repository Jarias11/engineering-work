# Computer Engineering Projects

This repository showcases hardware and software projects developed during my undergraduate studies at NJIT. It includes work in computer architecture, signal processing, digital logic, and applied machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Areas
- `cpu-design/`: RTL and VHDL implementations of CPU components
- `machine-learning-projects/`: AI applications built with Jetson Nano and PyTorch
- `digital-logic-circuits/`: ALUs, RPN calculators, and sequential logic designs
- `signal-processing/`: MATLAB signal analysis, transforms, and filters
- `system-modeling/`: Petri net and Markov-based simulations of discrete event systems

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
`VHDL`, `MATLAB`, `Python`, `Multisim`, `Jetson Nano`, `PyTorch`, `Z-transform`, `Fourier/Laplace analysis`, `Petri Nets`, `Verilog`
